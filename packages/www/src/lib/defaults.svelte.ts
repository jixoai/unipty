/**
 * jixoai defaults tool (registry/files/lib/defaults.svelte.ts,
 * context-defaults-economy task 1.1, 2026-09-03).
 *
 * The TOOL layer of the Defaults seam — the organization layer around
 * context reads, not a new foundation (design.md 定位). Compose's
 * CardDefaults translated to Svelte 5: each component family ships ONE
 * `defineComponentDefaults({ ...slots })` contract object; a slot is a
 * branded callable resolving `explicit ?? ambient ?? own` when the
 * consumer's `$derived` window evaluates `XxxDefaults.resolve({...})`.
 *
 * Orthogonal intents:
 *   1. brand — a module-private unique symbol (declare-const type twin
 *      + Symbol value twin, the kernel BRAND idiom): only this
 *      module's factories construct a DefaultsSlot
 *   2. dual guard — the type brand PLUS a factory-product WeakSet: a
 *      reflection copy carries the brand but misses the registration,
 *      so defineComponentDefaults rejects cast-forged and
 *      marker-copied slots at contract construction. The runtime half
 *      runs IN DEV ONLY (`import.meta.env?.DEV`, D3-B): the type
 *      brand is the production contract, and vitest runs under vite
 *      with DEV=true so the guard stays test-observed
 *   3. the ONE construction entry — defineAxisSlot(name, resolve):
 *      the axis factories (definePaintSlot/densitySlot, task 1.2) and
 *      the literal family factories below all route through it; the AST
 *      gate pins the identifier to registry/files/lib/** (this
 *      canonical tree — apps/www/src/lib is its byte mirror)
 *   4. the literal family, slot-values-first (D1) —
 *      defineLiteralSlot(values, own) / defineOpenSlot<T>(own) /
 *      absentSlot<T>() (absent IS the state; the output carries
 *      undefined). The values tuple is the TYPE SOURCE (OneOf): const
 *      generic inference replaces the explicit type argument —
 *      omitting either parameter, or a default outside the tuple, is
 *      a compile error (真·强制 by construction; the NoInfer/= never
 *      discipline is RETIRED for this factory). defineOpenSlot serves
 *      the open scalar domains (no closed union to enumerate) and
 *      keeps the absentSlot discipline: NoInfer + `= never` (TS ≥
 *      5.4) — the explicit type argument is the ONLY enforcement face.
 *
 * 惰性律: this module reads ZERO context and imports NOTHING —
 * construction captures only `own`; the ambient supply is the axis
 * module's closure-held getter, lazily evaluated at resolve time
 * inside the consumer's component window, never a snapshot and never
 * a module-level read here. The window is a HARD CONTRACT (D3-C):
 * outside component initialisation Svelte's own
 * lifecycle_outside_component propagates — never caught, never
 * normalized, never message-matched. The byte mirror installs whole,
 * zero burden.

 * never re-entered, never normalized.

 * messages and the gate report cite from one source (it rides the
